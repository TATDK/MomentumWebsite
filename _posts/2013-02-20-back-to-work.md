<p>We are back from holiday;</p>
<p>We had a good holiday here at Shoon Games and we hope that you had a good week as well.</p>
<p>Something big is going to happen this week for Shoon Games, we hope to get our microphones on Friday. </p>
<p>Monday the 25th February,  there will be a judge coming by from the game industry, whom will take a look at our game and hopefully give us some feedback, we are looking forward to this, and once again we will have a busy week here at Shoon Games.</p>
<p>As always, here is some artwork from our lovely art team.</p>

    Stay tuned for updates later this week!<br />
