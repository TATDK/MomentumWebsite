            <h1>New Company Name!</h1>
            <p>Hello everyone hope you are all having a great week. Here at Momentum we are happy to announce the company name and logo. It&rsquo;s all going to be on the Facebook page today hopefully you guys like what we made.</p><p>First news of the day is that we have changed our company name to Shoon Games, we really hope that you like the new name.</p><p>What are the guys up to in Shoon Games? Do you want to know?</p><p>Good because today I was walking around asking different people in Shoon Games how the work is going and what they are doing.</p><div style='width:475px;text-align:center;font-weight:bold;float:right'>

    <p><small>Here is a concept drawing of a possible enemy and the wife to our beloved hero. Also the front of the momentum device</small></p>
</div><p>The audio people is working on the environmental sounds for our wasteland level. They will soon receive a good studio microphone which they are excited to play around with.</p><p>Design team is working hard on getting the first playable test level to work they are fully working on designing the level to test some of our mechanic and tweaking the valuables to fit the game play better. The design team seems a little stressed but hopefully they get to the deadline in time.</p><p>Our programmer is working on the spawning /respawning script, we would like to see you spawn at the right place when you die. Everything seems good and no stress at all from the programmer.</p><p>The Art team is busy and some of them are drawing some amazing art work others are working on 3D objects, everybody seems to be working really hard to get to their next object, they are still having some fun with their work.</p><p>Everybody seems to be good at helping eachother and that is an awesome thing to experience, nobody is outside of the group here at Shoon Games. I&rsquo;m looking forward to write another blog post soon.</p><p>Until then have a great week.</p><p><strong>Andreas Gommesen PR - Shoon Games</strong></p><br />
